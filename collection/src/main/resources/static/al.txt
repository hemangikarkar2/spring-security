The important points about Java ArrayList class are:
Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
In ArrayList, manipulation is little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
Hierarchy of ArrayList class
As shown in the above diagram, Java ArrayList class extends AbstractList class which implements List interface. The List interface extends the Collection and Iterable interfaces in hierarchical order.
ArrayList class declaration
Let's see the declaration for java.util.ArrayList class.
1.	public class ArrayList<E> extends AbstractList<E> implements List<E>, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable
